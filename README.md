# Messi_Analysis
### ⚽ Introduction 💻
As an ardent fan of Lionel Messi and a Data Science enthusiast this is my first project stepping into Data Analysis/Visualisation based on free data by statsbomb. this analysis consists of comparison of 4 parts of his career of La Liga - Seasons 07/08-08/09-09/10, 10/11-11/12-12/13, 13/14-14/15-15/16, 16/17-17/18-18/19. I have analysed Messi's Dribbling, Passes, Passes Recieved and Goals and how these changed over the years. Do enjoy the Analysis.
